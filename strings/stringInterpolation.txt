type of variables-string variables-string interpolation/ f-String(python3.6+)

>>> name = "Biblio"
>>> f'Hello,{name}!'
'Hello, Biblio!'

>>> a = 5
>>> b = 10
>>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.'

Formatted string literals are a Python parser feature that converts f-strings into a series of string constants and expressions. They then get joined up to build the final string.
